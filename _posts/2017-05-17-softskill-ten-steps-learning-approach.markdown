In the software development world, technologies are involving rapidly. How to keep up with the changes? John Z. Sonmez gave some advises on how to learn new technologies and skills in his book *Soft Skills - The software developer's life manual*, which my ex-colleague recommend to read. John invented the '10-steps system' to let you teach yourself efficiently.

> If you constantly rely on someone else to teach you and never learn the skills to teach yourself, you’ll be greatly limiting your opportunities to advance your skills and knowledge.  
> One of the most important skills a software developer can learn is theskill of self-teaching.   
> If you actually teach what you’re trying to learn to someone else, not only do you remember it, but you get a much deeper understanding of it.  
>> ***The great aim of education is not knowledge but action.***  
>> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Herbert Spencer  

> If you can gain enough knowledge about a subject to start playing around, you can tap into the powerful creative and curious nature of your own mind. We tend to absorb more information and develop more meaningful questions about a thing when we’re actively playing.  
> Playing and having fun. That natural exploration and curiosity helped to learn so much information with so little effort.  
> Once you’ve played around and you have all kinds of questions, only then go back and read the text. Now when you go back to your reference material, you’ll approach it with a greater desire to devour and absorb its contents.   
> Then you can take what you’ve learned and reapply it to your play. See how the new tools you’ve learned about fit into your play and solve the problems you had. Explore new areas and unlock new questions that need solutions. Repeat this cycle over and over again as you inch forward in knowledge for the purpose of solving the problems you discover as you play.  
> Finally, seal it all in cement by teaching what you’ve learned to someone else. Teaching might be as simple as having a conversation with your spouse about what you’ve learned or it might be writing a blog post. The key is to regurgitate that information in your own words and organize the thoughts somewhere outside of your head.  

> **There were three main things I needed to know to be able to learn a technology:**  
> 1． How to get started — What were the basic things I needed to know to get started using whatever I was learning?    
> 2． The breadth of the subject — Have a decent overview of what I could do and what was possible, I could always find more details later.  
> 3． The basics -  20% I could learn that would cover 80% of my daily usage.

> ## The 10-step system

> ### Steps 1–6: Do these once
> ![Step 1~6](https://ejres-1253687085.picgz.myqcloud.com/img/10step_learning/step_1-6_en.png)

> #### Step 1: Get the big picture
> Know about “unknown unknowns,” or basically what you don’t know that you don’t know. If put these “unknown unknowns” for later discovery, the problem with this approach is that you’re very likely to learn the wrong thing or get in way over your head. It’s important to at least understand a little bit about a subject before diving into it. Then you can figure out exactly what you need to learn and decide the best way to do it.  
> You might start out by searching the internet for everything you could find on the subject, You could probably have a good idea of how big the topic is and what kind of subtopics exist within a few hours of research. To complete this step, do some basic research on the topic you want to learn about.  
> You can probably accomplish most of this research using internet searches. If you happen to have a book on the subject, you might read an introductory chapter to skim through the material. Don’t spend too much time on this step, though.   

> #### Step 2: Determine scope  
> In any project, it’s important to determine the scope of that project so that you know how big it is and can prepare accordingly. Learning is no different.  
> One common failing point in learning is becoming overwhelmed by trying to tackle something that’s too big.    
> You might be tempted to make your scope bigger and less focused, because you want to learn about different subtopics in your topic area, but resist the temptation and try to be as focused as possible.   
> You can only learn one thing at a time. You can always come back later and learn about other subtopics that branch off of your original topic, but for now, pick one narrowly focused thing and go with it.  

> #### Step 3: Define success  
> Have a clear picture in your mind of what success will look like. You can more easily work backwards from the goal to determine the steps you need to take to get there.  
> Make sure you have a specific set of success criteria that you can use to adequately assess whether or not you’ve met your learning goal.  
> Good success criteria are specific, not ambiguous. Don’t make a vague statement about what you want to accomplish.

> #### Step 4: Find resources  
> Instead of reading a single book on a subject, try to gather many different resources to help you learn. Today, with the wide availability of the internet and all the different content available on it, you can find many resources for almost any topic you want to learn about.
> Find as many resources as possible for learning about the topic you’ve selected. Don’t worry about quality at this point. This is similar to a brainstorming step. Later on you’ll filter your resources and select the best ones, but for now you want to get as many different resources as possible.  
>  
> **RESOURCE IDEAS**  
> * Books  
> * Blog posts  
> * Online videos  
> * Experts or people already knowledgeable about the topic you want to learn about  
> * Podcasts  
> * Source code  
> * Example projects  
> * Online documentation  

> #### Step 5: Create a learning plan  
> Find a way to break down the topic into smaller sections.   
> Create your own learning path. In fact, your learning path will probably be very similar to the table of contents of a book when you’re done.  
> Look at the table of contents of several of the books I’ve chosen as possible resources from step 4. If five different authors have chosen to break up their content into the same sets of modules and the same ordering, chances are I should make my learning plan follow a similar approach. Many books will cover more than what you need to know to achieve your objectives, and many books will also be poorly organized.  

> #### Step 6: Filter resources  
> Now it’s time to whittle those resources down to the handful of most valuable ones that will help you achieve your goal. Much of the data is redundant and not all of it will fit your learning plan.  
> Go through all the resources you’ve gathered in step 4 and figure out which ones have content that will help you to best cover the content in your learning plan. Also take a look at reviews and try to determine which resources are of the highest quality.  

> ### Steps 7–10: Repeat these  
> ![Step 7~10](https://ejres-1253687085.picgz.myqcloud.com/img/10step_learning/step_7-10_en.png)

> #### Step 7: Learn enough to get started  
> There are two common learning mistakes that most people make, myself included. First, there’s the problem of jumping in without knowing enough—acting too soon. Second, there’s the problem of preparing too much before jumping in—acting too late. Strike a balance between the two and learn just enough to get started.
> The key to this step is to not go too far. It’s easy to get carried away and start consuming all the resources you have on the module you’re trying to learn, but you’ll find the most success if you can avoid that temptation. Instead, focus on learning the minimal amount you’ll need to get started and to be able to experiment on your own in the next step.  
> ![playing around](https://ejres-1253687085.picgz.myqcloud.com/img/10step_learning/playing_around.png)

> #### Step 8: Play around  
> This step is both fun and scary. It’s fun because you get to do exactly what the step says: play around. But it’s scary because the step is completely unbounded.    
> You don’t read everything upfront, but one of the first things you do is play and experiment on your own.   
> As you play around, your brain naturally forms questions: How does this work? What happens if I do this? How do I solve this problem? These questions lead you in the direction of what’s actually important. When you get back and find the answers to your own questions, not only will it be more rewarding, but you’ll remember more of what you study.  
> Write down the questions that you have but don’t have answers for. You’ll have the opportunity to look for the answers to those questions in the next step.  

> #### Step 9: Learn enough to do something useful  
> Curiosity is a critical component of learning—especially self-learning. Unfortunately, as we grow up, much of that curiosity tends to disappear as we start to take the world for granted.    
> In step 8, you played around and hopefully came up with some questions that you couldn’t find answers to on your own. Now is the time to answer those questions. For this step, you’ll go through all the resources you gathered and learn about your module in depth.  
> Take as much time as you need to thoroughly understand your subject matter by reading and experimenting, watching and doing. Remember, though, you still don’t have to completely consume every single resource you gathered.   
> Try to tie what you’re learning back to your ultimate goal. 

> #### Step 10: Teach  
>> ***Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.***  
>> 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　———Benjamin Franklin    
>
> Most people are afraid to teach.  
> It’s easy to be filled with thoughts of self-doubt when you’re considering whether you’re worthy or not to teach what you know—or you think you know—to someone else. But if you want to learn a subject in depth, if you really want to gain understanding about a subject, you have to teach it.  
> In reality, you only need to be one step ahead of someone to teach them. Sometimes, in fact, experts who are many steps ahead of a student have a hard time teaching, because they can’t relate to the student. They end up glossing over details that they think are simple, because they don’t remember what it was like to be a beginner.  
> Move out of your comfort zone and teach what you’ve learned to someone else.   
> It’s a great way to fill in the gaps in your own learning as you try to explain it to others. It’s a process that will cause you to really dissect and understand the topic you’re learning about in your own mind as you organize the information in a way that will make it understandable to others. The important thing is that you actually take some time to take what you’ve learned out of your own mind and organize it in a way that someone else can understand. When you go through this process, you’ll find that there are many things that you thought you understood that you didn’t.   
>  
> **WAYS TO TEACH**   
> * Write a blog post.  
> * Create a YouTube video or tutorial.  
> * Give a presentation.  
> * Have a conversation with a friend or your spouse.  
> * Answer questions in an online forum.
