> Apache HBase™ is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.  
> Use Apache HBase™ when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data.   
> This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.   
> Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
