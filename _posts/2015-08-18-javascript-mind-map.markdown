> ECMAScript is a scripting language standardized by Ecma International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. Scripting languages such as JavaScript, JScript and ActionScript are supersets of ECMAScript. Although JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript have more capabilities than ECMAScript, by defining more objects and methods, the core features of these languages are the same as ECMAScript.  
> ECMAScript 6 is the sixth version and the seventh edition of the ECMAScript language. In short, it is also called "ES6".  
> Although JavaScript is extremely powerful and flexible, it's often criticized for having unnecessary redundancy. ES6 was introduced to improve JavaScript and ensure that developers no longer needed to use abstractions or other techniques to write quality code, which was becoming a lengthy process.
