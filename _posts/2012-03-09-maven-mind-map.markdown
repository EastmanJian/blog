> Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. In Yiddish, the word maven means "accumulator of knowledge".  
> Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second, it describes its dependencies.  
> Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
