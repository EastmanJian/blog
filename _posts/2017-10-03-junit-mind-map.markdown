> JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development.  
> JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.  
> JUnit 5 is the result of JUnit Lambda and its crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.  
> Important new features comparing to jUnit 4 are:  
>  * Nested Unit Tests
>  * JUnit Extensions
>  * Conditions
>  * Lambda Support
>  * Parameterized Tests
